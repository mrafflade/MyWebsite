      <h1>Hello, I’m <span>Prince Afflade</span></h1>
      <p>
        I am a third-year IT student with a strong interest in networking, web
        development, and database management. I have hands-on experience in
        designing and troubleshooting networks, as well as building responsive
        websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My academic projects and
        teamwork experiences have strengthened my problem-solving skills,
        adaptability, and attention to detail. I am eager to apply my knowledge
        in real-world environments through internships and practical
        opportunities. My goal is to grow into a versatile IT professional who
        contributes innovative solutions to technological challenges.
